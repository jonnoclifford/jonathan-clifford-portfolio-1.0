# Jonathan Clifford Single Page Portfolio Site

## Description

This task involved building a single page portfolio for myself, advertising my services as a photographer & designer.

### Tasks completed

* When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my portfolio, and how to contact me.
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of your portfolio.
* When presented with the the first portfolio then that portolios's image should be larger in size than the others
* When portolio items are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to user's viewport
